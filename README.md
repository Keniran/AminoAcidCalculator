# AminoAcidCalculator
Takes any codon and gives the corresponding amino acid.
Note: Any mRNA bases typed must be in ALL CAPS

How to Use:

  You will first be asked to select either "1" or "2".
    If you want to type in 3 bases per line and get an amino acid after each codon, enter "1".
    If you want to type all your bases at once (one per line) and get the corresponding amino acids afterwards, enter "2".

  If "1" was entered:
    Type in three mRNA bases per line.
    If you followed instructions correctly, it should give you the corresponding amino acid after each codon (three bases).
  
  If "2" was entered:
    Type in one mRNA base per line.
    If you want to stop typing in bases, just press enter without typing anything.
    If you followed instructions correctly, it should give you all the amino acids corresponding to the codons you typed.
